# üåü Prodigy Infotech Summer Internship 2024 - Project Showcase üåü

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Prodigy Infotech Summer Internship 2024! This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with cybersecurity projects.

This are the tasks that [@Peris034](https://github.com/Peris034/) had done during Summer-2024.

## üöÄ Introduction

**Internship Period:** 15 May 2024 - 15 June 2024  

The internship period was of 5 weeks, focusing on developing tools related to Cyber Security using Python.

## Projects

### Task 1: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This project involves creating a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

#### Features
- **Encryption**: Encrypts the input message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a user-defined shift value.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the encrypted message using the same shift value.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input the message and shift value.

### **Task 2: Image Manipulation**

This project involves creating a Python tool for basic image manipulation, including resizing, cropping, and applying filters. Users can input an image file and choose from various manipulation options.

#### **Features**
- **Resizing**: Resize images to specified dimensions.
- **Cropping**: Crop images to a user-defined area.
- **Filters**: Apply filters such as grayscale, sepia, and blur.

### **Task 3: Password Strength Assessment Tool**

This project involves building a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the password's strength.

#### **Features**
- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Character Check**: Checks for the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Strength Feedback**: Provides feedback on the password's strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).

### **Task 4: Keylogger**

This project involves creating a Python-based keylogger for monitoring and logging keystrokes. The keylogger records keystrokes and saves them to a file for later analysis.

#### **Features**
- **Keystroke Logging**: Logs all keystrokes made by the user.
- **File Storage**: Saves the logged keystrokes to a file.
- **Stealth Mode**: Runs in the background without being easily detected.

### **Task 5: Network Packet Analyzer**

This project involves building a tool for capturing and analyzing network packets. Users can capture network traffic and analyze various packet details such as source, destination, protocol, and payload.

#### **Features**
- **Packet Capture**: Captures live network traffic.
- **Packet Analysis**: Analyzes packets for source, destination, protocol, and payload.
- **Filtering**: Allows users to filter packets based on criteria such as IP address and protocol.
